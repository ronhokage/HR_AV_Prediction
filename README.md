# HR_AV_Prediction
We aim to perform a analysis to see if the employees working in a particular firm, are predicted to get a promotion or not.
This is a hackathon problem from Analytics vidhya and the solution here, is in the top 10% of leaderboard.
# Problem Statement
We need to identify a set of employees based on recommendations/ past performance and they
need to go through the separate training and evaluation program for each vertical. These programs are based on the required skill of each vertical
At the end of the program, based on various factors such as training performance, KPI completion (only employees with KPIs completed greater than 60% are considered) etc., employee gets promotion
For above mentioned process, the final promotions are only announced after the evaluation and this leads to delay in transition to their new roles. 
Main intent is to help any organization identifying the eligible candidates at a particular checkpoint so that they can expedite the entire promotion cycle.
